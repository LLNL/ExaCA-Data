# ExaCA temperature example files
This repository contains supplementary temperature data files (the .txt files in the "Temperatures" subdirectory) for use with the ExaCA code (see https://github.com/LLNL/ExaCA). Within the ExaCA repository, there are 3 example files that use the external temperature data within this ExaCA-Data repository: examples/Inp_SimpleRaster.txt, which uses the file Temperatures/Master-Raster-150um.txt (a single layer of a raster pattern), examples/Inp_AMBenchMultilayer.txt, which uses the files Temperatures/1CA-FOAM-fluidflow.txt and Temperatures/2CA-FOAM-fluidflow.txt (a four layer Additive Manufacturing-like problem that alternates an odd and an even layer scan pattern), and examples/Inp_TwoLineTwoLayer.txt, which uses the file Temperatures/TwoLine.txt (segments from two overlapping line scan melt pools, repeated for two layers of a build).
To run those example problems, first ensure that a copy of the main ExaCA repository is checked out, then change directory to the ExaCA/examples folder and clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/LLNL/ExaCA-Data

When running the Inp_SimpleRaster.txt, Inp_AMBenchMultilayer.txt, and Inp_TwoLineTwoLayer.txt example problems, the external temperature data is assumed to be located in examples/Temperatures, though by modifying the input files themselves, the path to the temperature data can be changed. It should be noted that the temperature data in 1CA-FOAM-fluidflow.txt, 2CA-FOAM-fluidflow.txt, and Master-Raster-150um.txt only includes the final time that each cell in the simulation undergoes solidification, and no physically meaningful melting data is given (0s are in the "tm" column of these files) - correspondingly, the SimpleRaster and AMBenchMultilayer example problems are not designed to be run with remelting (the problem type in the input files is R). TwoLine.txt does include physical values for the time at which cells went above the liquidus (nonzero values in the "tm" column), and includes mutiple sets of (tm,tl,cr) data for cells that go above the below the liquidus multiple times (i.e., the cells in the overlap region between melt tracks). The TwoLineTwoLayer example problem is designed to be run with remelting (the problem type in this input file is RM), though it can also be run without remelting by changing the problem type to R.
